# Guided Project: Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes
### Introduction

In this guided project, we used the Naive Bayes algorithm to build a spam filter for SMS messages that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80%. To train the computer to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages, we used the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm along with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that were manually classified by humans.

### Data

The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection'>The UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. The data collection process along is described in more details <a href='http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/#composition'>on this page</a>. The authors' papers related to the above-mentioned dataset can be found also by following <a href='http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/#composition'>this link</a>.

### Outcome

In this project, we managed to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The filter had an accuracy of 98.74% on the test set.
